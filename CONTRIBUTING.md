# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to our project. Contributions help us grow our project and community.

## Issues

If you have a bug report or a feature request, please file an issue under the correct template. Include any relative information. If you are submitting a bug report, include stack traces and errors. If you are submitting a feature request, include details about what the feature does, and what problems it solves.

## Pull Requests

If you wish to submit code to the project, please discuss it in an issue first. If you are working on an existing issue (bug or feature) let people know to prevent wasted hours when multiple people try to work on the same issue.

Please make sure to include a description about what your pull request adds, changes and removes. This makes merging pull requests easier and faster.
